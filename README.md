# SNCF Lost and Found Items

## Description

Trains have always been present throught the history of mankind as a means of transportation, for people as well as objects. When you are a traveler, most certainly there will always be an announcement telling you to take care of your luggage. With this in mind, I tried to analyze which items are the most lost and the most found in the trains stations around France.

In this project, **SQL** was used to explore datasets, from French railway company SNCF, which contains information about lost and found items in almost all the train stations in France. These datasets are available at the open-source website from the company, found <a href="https://data.sncf.com/explore/?sort=modified" title="Download" download>here</a>.
After exploring and a bit of manipulation, the data was exported to a csv file and further manipulated in **Power BI**. Some new temporary tables and aggregate functions where used with the help of **PowerQuery**. Then, the data was visualized.
